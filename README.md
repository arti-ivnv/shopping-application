# shopping-application

Unfortunately, I have to stop doing this project.<br>
I was following a YouTube tutorial helping me to achieve much better understanding of Microservice architecture.<br>
However, now most some of the techh tools are either outdated or sould be performed differently.<br>
In this case, I find it better to start a new pet project that I will complete from scratch researching and performing better practices.<br>
Otherwise, I will spent more time fixing somebody else tutorial project.<br><br>

Things that I was not able to implement are: <br><br>

1) Event Driven Architecture using Kafka<br>
2) Dockerization of the application<br>
3) Monitoring (via Promethous and  Graphana)<br>

I guess it's good to say that "Every fail is nothing more than experiance" and I am sad that I cannnot get this project done till the end.<br>
